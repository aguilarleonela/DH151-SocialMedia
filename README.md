INTRODUCTION
 
## Overview
The research inquiry focuses on the usage of different messaging platforms in different countries/ areas of the world. This is a matter of importance in comparing and analyzing the preferences of messaging platforms used in different regions to understand consumer choices.
 
Potential Research Questions:
Why are specific social media platforms more influential in other regions more than others? 
How does the main social media app used in said region influence the consumers of their surrounding area? 
Are specific social media platforms more popular in some regions because of the values, principles, or ethics of those aligned	with most of the people there? 
 
## Methodology
We decided to choose web mapping as a methodology of inquiry because of the various regions around the world having multiple social media platforms that shape each country and their society. Furthermore, since we are trying to illustrate the data in terms of different regions, it is useful to visualize a map that better tells the story than purely text or simple charts.

## Technical Scope
We would like to design our web pages using css and writing them in HTML, which we can share and edit the codes using Google Docs. We are also collaborating on Github, so we can push, pull, and sync our collaborative work via Visual Studio Code. Moreover, we will include Javascript for interactive elements such as an interactive web through Leaflet.
 
## Geographic Scope
We would like to look at the globe and the biggest countries, such as Russia, China, United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, India, and etc. After the web mapping, we can potentially focus on specific regions where we find interesting patterns.
